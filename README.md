# Planet_Orbits
Python project for visualising planetary orbits in our solar system

# TEMPLATE
Using tutorial from youtuber [Tech With Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTLPmUHTPqo) 
and his [Repo](https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Planet-Simulation) as a guide

What its supposed to look like:

I plan to add the full 8 planets using the same class system.

For example:

```python
earth = Planet(-1 * Planet.AU, 0, 16, BLUE, 5.9742 * 10**24)
earth.y_vel = 29.783 * 1000 
```
